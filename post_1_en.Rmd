One of my most loving memories of waigong and one that has stuck with me is when he taught me how to knead dough. Waigong was always very strong, and his back was firm like an ox. But even so, it was the grace with which he could knead dough which always allowed him to cook beautiful dough-based dishes for us, such as mantou, qun bing, and noodles.

<br>

He taught me where to press the dough, and where to exert force when kneading down into the dough. The key point was around kneading down and through the dough to allow the gluten to form. In this way the dough could become springy and rest well.
